    Components at the Top:
        kubectl CLI: This is the command-line interface for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
        UI: Represents the user interface for managing the cluster.
        Both of these components connect to the internet via the cloud.

    Control Plane (Middle Section):
        Kubernetes API: The entry point for commands from kubectl CLI and the UI.
        etcd: A distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store cluster data.
        Controllers: Processes that monitor different parts of the cluster.
        Scheduler: Determines which node runs an unassigned pod based on resource availability.
        Cloud Controller: Connects with provider-specific APIs (e.g., in a cloud environment).

    Worker Nodes (Bottom Section):
        Each worker node contains:
            kubelet: An agent ensuring containers run in pods.
            kube-proxy: Manages network rules on nodes.
            Container Runtime: Software for running containers.
            Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

    Connections:
        Bidirectional arrows connect components within the Control Plane (API, etcd, Controllers, Scheduler).
        Unidirectional arrows point from internal components of worker nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy, Container Runtime) to their respective pods.
        Bidirectional arrows link worker nodes to Controllers and Scheduler.
        An arrow from Cloud Controller points to external “Provider APIs.”
