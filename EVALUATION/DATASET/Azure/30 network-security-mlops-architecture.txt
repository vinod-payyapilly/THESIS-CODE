Dataflow

The architecture diagram shows a sample MLOps solution.

    The virtual network named AML VNET helps protect the Azure Machine Learning workspace and its associated resources.

    The jump host, Azure Bastion, and self-hosted agents belong to another virtual network named BASTION VNET. This arrangement simulates having another solution that requires access to the resources within Azure Machine Learning virtual network.

    With the support of virtual network peering and private DNS zones, Azure Pipelines can execute on self-host agents and trigger the Azure Machine Learning pipelines that are published in the Azure Machine Learning workspace to train, evaluate, and register the machine learning models.

    Finally, the model is deployed to online endpoints or batch endpoints that are supported by Azure Machine Learning compute or Azure Kubernetes Service clusters.

Components

The sample MLOps solution consists of these components:

    Data storage: Azure Blob Storage for data storage.
    Model training, validation, and registration: Azure Machine Learning workspace
    Model deployment: Azure Machine Learning endpoints and Azure Kubernetes Service
    Model monitor: Azure Monitor for Application Insights
    MLOps pipelines: Azure DevOps and Azure Pipelines
