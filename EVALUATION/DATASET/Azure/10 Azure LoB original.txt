This example shows how you can modernize your legacy systems that can't support new processes, therefore providing a better user experience.

Dataflow

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    Supplier data stored in CDS is moved to SQL via Data Factory.
    Purchase order (PO) data stored in ERP system is sent to Azure SQL database.
    Azure Functions uses API to surface PO data monthly and creates a task for users to review.
    Power Apps retrieves data from Azure SQL Database through API.
    User reviews and updates POs in Power Apps and sends this data to suppliers through CSV export.
    Power BI reports trends in supplier status.

Components

Data is loaded from these different data sources using several Azure components:

    Power Apps: Increase agility across your organization by rapidly building low-code apps that modernize processes and solve tough challenges.
    Azure Functions: Accelerate and simplify application development with serverless compute
    Azure API management: Hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments
    Azure SQL Database: Build apps that scale with the pace of your business with managed and intelligent SQL in the cloud
    Azure Data Factory: Hybrid data integration service that simplifies ETL at scale
    Power BI: a suite of business analytics tools to analyze data and share insights. Power BI can query a semantic model stored in Analysis Services, or it can query Azure Synapse directly.
