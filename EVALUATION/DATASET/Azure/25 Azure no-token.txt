Workflow

    A user selects Sign in in the single-page application.
    The single-page application invokes Authorization Code flow via a redirect to the Microsoft Entra authorization endpoint.
    Users authenticate themselves.
    An Authorization Code flow response with an authorization code is redirected to the API Management callback endpoint.
    The API Management policy exchanges the authorization code for an access token by calling the Microsoft Entra token endpoint.
    The Azure API Management policy redirects to the application and places the encrypted access token in an HttpOnly cookie.
    The user invokes an external API call from the application via an API Management proxied endpoint.
    The API Management policy receives the API request, decrypts the cookie, and makes a downstream API call, adding the access token as an Authorization header.

Components

    Microsoft Entra ID provides identity services, single sign-on, and multifactor authentication across Azure workloads.
    API Management is a hybrid multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments. API Management creates consistent, modern API gateways for existing backend services.
    Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. Deployments are triggered by changes made to application source code in GitHub or in Azure DevOps repositories.
