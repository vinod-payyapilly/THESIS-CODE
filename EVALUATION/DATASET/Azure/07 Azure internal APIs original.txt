In this scenario, an organization consolidates multiple APIs internally using Azure API Management deployed inside a Virtual Network.

Dataflow

The data flows as follows:

    Developers check in code to a GitHub repository that's connected to a CI/CD pipeline agent that's installed on an Azure VM.
    The agent pushes the build to the API application that's hosted on ILB ASE.
    Azure API Management consumes the preceding APIs via HOST headers that are specified in API Management policy.
    API Management uses the App Service Environment's DNS name for all the APIs.
    Application Gateway exposes API Management's developer and API portal.
    Azure Private DNS is used to route the traffic internally between ASE, API Management, and Application Gateway.
    External users utilize the exposed developer portal to consume the APIs via Application Gateway's public IP.

Components

    Azure Virtual Network enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
    Azure Private DNS allows domain names to be resolved in a virtual network without needing to add a custom DNS solution.
    Azure API Management helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to use their data and services.
    Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that helps you to manage traffic to your web applications.
    Internal Load Balancer App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale.
    Azure DevOps is a service for managing your development lifecycle and includes features for planning and project management, code management, build, and release.
    Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers on multiple platforms.
    Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service.
