Step 1
Data that lands in your Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket is picked up by the data lake pipeline and moved to the pre-stage S3 bucket.

Step 2
AWS Glue applies transformation logic on the incoming data to prepare it for analysis, storing the result in the post-stage S3 bucket.

Step 3
AWS Lake Formation controls access permissions to the transformed data in the staged S3 bucket.

Step 4
You can access the transformed data using Amazon Athena to run a query analysis on the staged S3 bucket.

Step 5
You can build dashboards in Amazon QuickSight from Athena queries that run on the staged data.
