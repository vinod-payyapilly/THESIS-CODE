Step 1
The AWS CloudFormation template deploys an Amazon CloudFront distribution that provides a caching layer to reduce the cost of image processing and the latency of subsequent image delivery. The CloudFront domain name provides cached access to the image handler API.

Step 2
Amazon API Gateway provides endpoint resources and initiate the AWS Lambda function.

Step 3
A Lambda function that retrieves the image from your existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, and uses sharp to return a modified version of the image to the API Gateway.

Step 4
An S3 bucket for log storage, separate from your customer-created S3 bucket for storing images. If selected, the solution deploys an S3 bucket for storing the optional demo UI.

Step 5
If you activate the image URL signature feature, the Lambda function retrieves the secret value from your existing AWS Secrets Manager secret to validate the signature.

Step 6
If you use the smart crop or content moderation features, the Lambda function calls Amazon Rekognition to analyze your image and returns the results.
