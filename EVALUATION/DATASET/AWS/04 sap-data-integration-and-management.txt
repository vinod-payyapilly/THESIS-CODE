Step 1
SAP data hosted on SAP RISE, SAP HANA Cloud, AWS, or on-premises systems can be extracted in real-time or batch and full or incremental mode from SAP NetWeaver systems, such as SAP ERP Central ECC, SAP S/4HANA, or SAP BW.
It can also be extracted with SAP HANA Database using options such as:

A. AWS Managed Services

B. SAP and other AWS Partner Solutions with dedicated instances

C. AWS Partner Solutions embedded in SAP NetWeaver


Data Integration Options

Step A
AWS Glue, a serverless data integration service, and Amazon AppFlow SAP OData connector offer application-level data extraction.

Step B2
Using SAP native integration, SAP Datasphere or SAP Data Services sends data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Redshift.

 

Step B3
SAP SLT replication engine supports replicating data to Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) using a database connection. AWS Partner Solutions such as Syntax CxLink support streaming data to Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis using ABAP add-on for SAP SLT.

 

Step C
AWS Partner Solutions embedded in SAP NetWeaver, such as SNP Glue, offer point-to-point data replication from SAP NetWeaver-based source system to the AWS Cloud.

 

Step 2
Data extracted from SAP can be landed in AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Kinesis, or Amazon RDS, combined with non-SAP data, further processed, and analyzed using AWS analytics and generative AI services.
