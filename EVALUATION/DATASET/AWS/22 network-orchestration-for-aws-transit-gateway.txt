Step 1
This template deploys an Amazon EventBridge rule that monitors specific virtual private cloud (VPC) and subnet tag changes.

Step 2
An EventBridge rule in the spoke account sends the tags to the EventBridge bus in the hub account.

Step 3
The rules associated with the EventBridge bus invoke an AWS Lambda function to start the solution workflow. 

Step 4
AWS Step Functions (solution state machine) processes network requests from the spoke accounts.

Step 5
The state machine workflow attaches a VPC to the transit gateway.

Step 6
The state machine workflow updates the VPC route table associated with the tagged subnet.

Step 7
The state machine workflow updates the transit gateway route table with association and propagation changes.

Step 8
(Optional) The state machine workflow updates the attachment name with the VPC name and the OU name for the spoke account (retrieved from the Org Management account).

Step 9
The solution updates Amazon DynamoDB with the information extracted from the event and resources created, updated, or deleted in the workflow.
