Step 1
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) issues a wildcard certificate for the custom domain (*.example.com) using DNS validation against the Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone for the “example.com” domain.

Step 2
The client application queries the Route 53 private hosted zone associated with your environment in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and receives a Canonical Name Record referencing the Network Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).

Step 3
The client application sends a RESTful API call to the Network Load Balancer.

Step 4
The Network Load Balancer forwards the request to the NGINX service running on AWS Fargate in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

Step 5
The NGINX service maps the Host header in the RESTful API call to the appropriate Amazon API Gateway private endpoint and forwards the request to the execute-api service endpoint in the same Amazon VPC.

Step 6
The request is forwarded to the appropriate API Gateway private endpoint using AWS PrivateLink.

Step 7
API Gateway validates the RESTful call source’s VPC endpoint, path, stage, and method against the resource policy and implements the request if allowed.
