The diagram includes the following components and processes:

    Amazon CloudFront provides a unique entry point to the application. The distribution has two origins: the first for static files and the second for the UI composer.

    Static files are hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. They are consumed by the browser and the UI composer for HTML templates.

    The UI composer runs on a containers cluster in AWS Fargate. With a containerized solution, you can use streaming capabilities and multithreaded rendering if needed.

    Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is used as a basic micro-frontends discovery system. This capability provides a key-value store used by the UI composer for retrieving the micro-frontend endpoints to consume.

    The notifications micro-frontend stores the optimized JavaScript bundle in the S3 bucket. This renders on the client because it must react to user interactions.

    The reviews micro-frontend is composed by a Lambda function, and the user reviews are stored in DynamoDB. The reviews micro-frontend is rendered fully on the server side, and it outputs an HTML fragment.

    The product details micro-frontend is a low-code micro-frontend that uses AWS Step Functions. The Express Workflow can be invoked synchronously, and it contains the logic for rendering the HTML fragment and a caching layer.
