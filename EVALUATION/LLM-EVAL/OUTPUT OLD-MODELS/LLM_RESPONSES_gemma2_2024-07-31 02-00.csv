The data flows as follows:

    Developers check in code to a GitHub repository that's connected to a CI/CD pipeline agent that's installed on an Azure VM.
    The agent pushes the build to the API application that's hosted on ILB ASE.
    Azure API Management consumes the preceding APIs via HOST headers that are specified in API Management policy.
    API Management uses the App Service Environment's DNS name for all the APIs.
    Application Gateway exposes API Management's developer and API portal.
    Azure Private DNS is used to route the traffic internally between ASE, API Management, and Application Gateway.
    External users utilize the exposed developer portal to consume the APIs via Application Gateway's public IP.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

**Explanation of Entities and Relationships:**

* **Entities:**
   * Each entity represents a software component, system, or person mentioned in the text. The type (""person,"" ""component,"" or ""system"") helps categorize them.
   * For example: ""airline system"" is a system, ""custom API"" is a component, and ""Azure API Management"" is a system.

* **Relationships:**
    * These describe how different entities interact with each other.  
    * The relationship types are: 
        * ""calls"": Indicates one entity initiates communication with another.
        * ""called-from"": Indicates one entity is invoked or called by another.
        * ""contains"": One entity encompasses or includes another.
        * ""part-of"": One entity is a component of another.
    * For example: 
        * ""airline system calls custom API"" means the airline system sends requests to the custom API.



**Important Notes:**

* The JSON structure precisely reflects the relationships and entities found in the provided text.
* I've avoided making assumptions or adding information not explicitly stated in the text.
* Relationships are directional; the order of entities matters (e.g., ""system calls component"" is different from ""component calls system"").","```json

        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    Developers check in code to a GitHub repository that's connected to a CI/CD pipeline agent that's installed on an Azure VM.
    The agent pushes the build to the API application that's hosted on ILB ASE.
    Azure API Management consumes the preceding APIs via HOST headers that are specified in API Management policy.
    API Management uses the App Service Environment's DNS name for all the APIs.
    Application Gateway exposes API Management's developer and API portal.
    Azure Private DNS is used to route the traffic internally between ASE, API Management, and Application Gateway.
    External users utilize the exposed developer portal to consume the APIs via Application Gateway's public IP.

2. **Relationships:** We've established relationships between these entities based on how they interact:
   -  **`contains`**: Used when one system or component holds another entity (e.g., CDS contains supplier data).
   -  **`part-of`**: Similar to `contains`, but often used for hierarchical structures within systems. We didn't find clear examples of this in the text. 
   - **`calls`**: Indicates a component initiates a connection or interaction with another (e.g., Azure Functions calls the API).
   - **`called-from`**: The reverse of `calls`, meaning one component is invoked by another (e.g., Power Apps is called from users).

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    The agent pushes the build to the API application that's hosted on ILB ASE.
    Azure API Management consumes the preceding APIs via HOST headers that are specified in API Management policy.
    API Management uses the App Service Environment's DNS name for all the APIs.
    Application Gateway exposes API Management's developer and API portal.

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

* **Entities:** We've identified key systems (APIM, Patient API, Audit API, Azure Cosmos DB) and components within those systems (functions like `CreatePatient`, `CreateAuditRecord`). We also have ""Outside services and clients"" as a type of user.
* **Relationships:**  We've captured the flow of information:
    * Clients call APIM.
    * APIM calls `CreatePatient`.
    * `CreatePatient` calls `CreateAuditRecord`, which then interacts with Azure Cosmos DB. 
    * `CreatePatient` also creates data in Azure Cosmos DB.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    API Management accepts API calls in the form of HTTP requests.

    API Management securely routes the HTTP requests to Logic Apps.

    Each HTTP request triggers a run in Logic Apps:
        Logic Apps uses secured template parameters to retrieve database credentials from Azure Key Vault.
        Logic Apps uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to send the database credentials and a database statement to the on-premises data gateway.

    The on-premises data gateway connects to a SQL Server database to run the statement.

    SQL Server stores the data and makes it available to apps that users access.

    Azure Monitor collects information on Logic Apps events and performance.

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

The data flows as follows:

    Developers check in code to a GitHub repository that's connected to a CI/CD pipeline agent that's installed on an Azure VM.
    The agent pushes the build to the API application that's hosted on ILB ASE.
    Azure API Management consumes the preceding APIs via HOST headers that are specified in API Management policy.
    API Management uses the App Service Environment's DNS name for all the APIs.
    Application Gateway exposes API Management's developer and API portal.
    Azure Private DNS is used to route the traffic internally between ASE, API Management, and Application Gateway.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

**Explanation:**

1. **Entities:** I've identified systems (like CDS, ERP system), components (like Data Factory, API), and types of data (""Supplier data,"" ""Purchase order (PO) data""). Each entity has a unique name, type, and a brief description based on the text.

2. **Relationships:**
   -  I've established relationships like ""contains"" (e.g., CDS contains Supplier data), ""calls"" (e.g., Azure Functions calls API), etc., based on the flow of information and actions described in the text. 
   -  Remember, ""part-of"" and ""contains"" are inverse relationships, so I only included one for each pair.

3. **JSON Format:** The JSON structure clearly organizes the entities and their relationships for easy understanding and potential further analysis.

**Explanation:**

1. **Entities:** I've identified systems (like CDS, ERP system), components (like Data Factory, API), and types of data (""Supplier data,"" ""Purchase order (PO) data""). Each entity has a unique name, type, and a brief description based on the text.

2. **Relationships:**
   -  I've established relationships like ""contains"" (e.g., CDS contains Supplier data), ""calls"" (e.g., Azure Functions calls API), etc., based on the flow of information and actions described in the text. 
   -  Remember, ""part-of"" and ""contains"" are inverse relationships, so I only included one for each pair.

3. **JSON Format:** The JSON structure clearly organizes the entities and their relationships for easy understanding and potential further analysis.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

**Explanation of the JSON:**

* **entities:** This section lists all identified entities, categorized by type (person, component, system). Each entity has a unique name, its type, and a brief description. 
* **relationships:** This section defines connections between entities. Each relationship is represented as a list containing:
    - **ENTITY_1:** The first entity involved in the relationship.
    - **RELATIONSHIP:** The type of relationship (calls, called-from, contains, part-of).
    - **ENTITY_2:** The second entity involved in the relationship.
    - **DESCRIPTION:** A short explanation of the relationship based on the text.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    API Management securely routes the HTTP requests to Logic Apps.

    Each HTTP request triggers a run in Logic Apps:
        Logic Apps uses secured template parameters to retrieve database credentials from Azure Key Vault.
        Logic Apps uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to send the database credentials and a database statement to the on-premises data gateway.

    The on-premises data gateway connects to a SQL Server database to run the statement.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

Let me break down the reasoning behind these entities and relationships:

* **Systems:** We identify ""APIM"", ""Patient API"", ""Audit API"", and ""Azure Cosmos DB"" as systems because they represent larger, interconnected components.
* **Components:** Within each system, we have functions like ""CreatePatient"" and ""CreateAuditRecord"" which are specific, functional units.
* **People/Clients:**  ""Outside services and clients"" represents the users interacting with the system.

**Relationships:**

* The relationships are derived directly from the text's verb choices:
    * ""calls"" indicates a function initiating a request to another function.
    * ""called-from"" indicates a function being invoked by another function.

Let me break down the reasoning behind these entities and relationships:

* **Systems:** We identify ""APIM"", ""Patient API"", ""Audit API"", and ""Azure Cosmos DB"" as systems because they represent larger, interconnected components.
* **Components:** Within each system, we have functions like ""CreatePatient"" and ""CreateAuditRecord"" which are specific, functional units.
* **People/Clients:**  ""Outside services and clients"" represents the users interacting with the system.

**Relationships:**

* The relationships are derived directly from the text's verb choices:
    * ""calls"" indicates a function initiating a request to another function.
    * ""called-from"" indicates a function being invoked by another function.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

**Explanation:**

1. **Entity Identification:**
   - We identified key systems like CDS, SQL databases, ERP systems, Azure Functions, Power Apps, and Power BI. 
   - Components within these systems (e.g., Data Factory, API) were also recognized.
   - ""Supplier data"" and ""PO data"" are treated as entities representing the information flow.

2. **Relationship Extraction:**

   - We established relationships based on the text's description of how data moves:
     - Systems contain data (e.g., ""CDS contains Supplier Data"").
     - Components perform actions within systems (e.g., ""Data Factory calls SQL""). 
     - Components call APIs to interact with other systems.
     -  Power Apps retrieves data from Azure SQL Database and sends updates through CSV Export.

**Important Notes:**

* **Accuracy:** The JSON output reflects the information explicitly stated in the provided text. It does not make assumptions or inferences beyond what is written.
* **Scope:** This analysis focuses solely on software architecture aspects mentioned in the text. Other potential relationships (e.g., business processes) are not included.

117,gemma2,../IMAGES NEW/Azure/15 Azure automate-document-classification.txt,"
    The user provides a document file that the web app uploads. The file contains multiple documents of various types. It can, for instance, be a PDF or multipage TIFF file.
        The document file is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
        The web app adds a command message to a storage queue to initiate pipeline processing.

    Durable Functions orchestration is triggered by the command message. The message contains metadata that identifies the location in Blob Storage of the document file to be processed. Each Durable Functions instance processes only one document file.

    The Scan activity function calls the Computer Vision Read API, passing in the location in storage of the document to be processed. Optical character recognition (OCR) results are returned to the orchestration to be used by subsequent activities.

    The Classify activity function calls the document classifier service that's hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This service uses regular expression pattern matching to identify the starting page of each known document and to calculate how many document types are contained in the document file. The types and page ranges of the documents are calculated and returned to the orchestration.



Note

Azure doesn't offer a service that can classify multiple document types in a single file. This solution uses a non-Azure service that's hosted in AKS.

The Metadata Store activity function saves the document type and page range information in an Azure Cosmos DB store.

The Indexing activity function creates a new search document in the Cognitive Search service for each identified document type and uses the Azure AI Search libraries for .NET to include in the search document the full OCR results and document information. A correlation ID is also added to the search document so that the search results can be matched with the corresponding document metadata from Azure Cosmos DB.

End users can search for documents by contents and metadata. Correlation IDs in the search result set can be used to look up document records that are in Azure Cosmos DB. The records include links to the original document file in Blob Storage.

    Data owners upload datasets into a public blob storage account. The data is encrypted by using Microsoft-managed keys.

    Azure Data Factory uses a trigger that starts copying of the uploaded dataset to a specific location (import path) on another storage account with security controls. The storage account can only be reached through a private endpoint. Also, it's accessed by a service principal with limited permissions. Data Factory deletes the original copy making the dataset immutable.

    Researchers access the secure environment through a streaming application using Azure Virtual Desktop as a privileged jump box.

    The dataset in the secure storage account is presented to the data science VMs provisioned in a secure network environment for research work. Much of the data preparation is done on those VMs.

    The secure environment has Azure Machine Learning compute that can access the dataset through a private endpoint for users for Azure Machine Learning capabilities, such as to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models. At this point, models are created that meet regulatory guidelines. All model data is de-identified by removing personal information.

    Models or de-identified data is saved to a separate location on the secure storage (export path). When new data is added to the export path, a logic app is triggered. In this architecture, the logic app is outside the secure environment because no data is sent to the logic app. Its only function is to send notification and start the manual approval process.

    The app starts an approval process requesting a review of data that is queued to be exported. The manual reviewers ensure that sensitive data isn't exported. After the review process, the data is either approved or denied.

    Note

    If an approval step is not required on exfiltration, the logic app step could be omitted.

    If the de-identified data is approved, it's sent to the Data Factory instance.

    Data Factory moves the data to the public storage account in a separate container to allow external researchers to have access to their exported data and models. Alternately, you can provision another storage account in a lower security environment.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage. Audio files are uploaded to an Azure Storage account via a supported method, such as the UI-based tool, Azure Storage Explorer, or a Storage SDK or API.

    Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files in Batch mode asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.

    Azure AI Language is used to detect and redact personal data in the transcript.

    For batch mode transcription and personal data detection and redaction, use the AI services Ingestion Client tool. The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach for call center transcription.

    Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore for keeping track of metadata and for reporting. Use Azure OpenAI to process the stored transcription information.

    Power BI or a custom web application that's hosted by App Service is used to visualize the output. Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a customer relationship management (CRM), so agents have contextual information about why the customer called and can quickly solve potential problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

The data flows through the solution as follows:

    The airline system communicates with a custom API hosted in Azure API Management.
    A custom API coordinator receives notifications and handles incoming messages from the airline system. It sends them to Power Apps, where flights are assigned to Microsoft Teams channels.
    When a user selects a flight to monitor, or when the system assigns the user to a flight, the system queues a Graph API call in an Azure Storage Account queue for further processing.
    Azure Functions runs the Graph API calls based on the incoming messages in the storage queue, sending notifications to Teams, and also streams all events to an Azure Event Hubs for further analytics.
    The airline's notification system is managed by a custom bot messaging service that employs Azure Bot Service.
    Custom bots send flight updates to users in Teams.
    An Azure Data Lake storage offers long-term retention and micro-batch processing of events from Event Hubs, ultimately generating insightful reports with Power BI.

    A Connect agent component captures change logs by using mainframe or midrange native utilities and caches the logs in temporary storage.
    For mainframe systems, a publisher component on the mainframe manages data migration.
    For midrange systems, in place of the publisher, a listener component manages data migration. It's located on either a Windows or Linux machine.
    The publisher or listener moves the data from on-premises to Azure via an enhanced-security connection. The publisher or listener handles the commit and rollback of transactions for each unit of work, maintaining the integrity of data.
    The Connect Replicator Engine captures the data from the publisher or listener and applies it to the target. It distributes data for parallel processing.
    The target is a database that receives the changes via ODBC or ingests the changes via Azure Event Hubs.
    The changed data is consumed by Azure Databricks and applied to Azure data platform services.
    The Connect Controller Daemon authenticates the request and establishes the socket connection between the publisher or listener and the Replicator Engine.

    A designated Outlook email account receives PDF files as attachments. The arrival of an email triggers a logic app to process the email. The logic app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps.
    The logic app uploads the PDF files to a container in Azure Data Lake Storage.
    You can also manually or programmatically upload PDF files to the same PDF container.
    The arrival of a PDF file in the PDF container triggers another logic app to process the PDF forms that are in the PDF file.
    The logic app sends the location of the PDF file to a function app for processing. The function app is built by using the capabilities of Azure Functions.
    The function app receives the location of the file and takes these actions:
        It splits the file into single pages if the file has multiple pages. Each page contains one independent form. Split files are saved to a second container in Data Lake Storage.
        It uses HTTPS POST, an Azure REST API, to send the location of the single-page PDF file to AI Document Intelligence for processing. When Azure AI Document Intelligence completes its processing, it sends a response back to the function app, which places the information into a data structure.
        It creates a JSON data file that contains the response data and stores the file to a third container in Data Lake Storage.
    The forms processing logic app receives the processed response data.
    The forms processing logic app sends the processed data to Azure Cosmos DB, which saves the data in a database and in collections.
    Power BI obtains the data from Azure Cosmos DB and provides insights and dashboards.
    You can implement further processing as needed on the data that's in Azure Cosmos DB.

    To gain access to an application, an API client authenticates by providing credentials such as username and password. The IdP is Azure AD B2C in this solution, but you can use a different one.

    The authentication request goes via Azure Front Door to Azure AD B2C, which is configured with a custom domain for sign-in. Azure AD B2C authenticates the user and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) bearer token back to the user.

    The client triggers an event that accesses a backend API. This event could be a click of a button on a web application or on a mobile device, or a direct call to the endpoint of the backend API.

    The request goes through Azure Front Door, whose back end is mapped to the public endpoint of API Management. API Management intercepts the request and validates the bearer token against Azure AD B2C by using its validate-jwt policy. If the token isn't valid, API Management rejects the request by responding with a 401 code.

    If the token is valid, API Management forwards the request to the appropriate backend API.

    The diagram shows backend APIs running in three environments:
        App Service Environment
        Function Apps
        Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

    APIs running in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments can also be integrated with API Management if network connectivity is established between the APIs and API Management.

    API Management accepts API calls in the form of HTTP requests.

    API Management securely routes the HTTP requests to Logic Apps.

    Each HTTP request triggers a run in Logic Apps:
        Logic Apps uses secured template parameters to retrieve database credentials from Azure Key Vault.
        Logic Apps uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to send the database credentials and a database statement to the on-premises data gateway.

    The on-premises data gateway connects to a SQL Server database to run the statement.

    SQL Server stores the data and makes it available to apps that users access.

    Backend systems. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the various backend systems that the enterprise has deployed or relies on. These systems might include SaaS systems, other Azure services, or web services that expose REST or SOAP endpoints.

    Azure Logic Apps. In this architecture, logic apps are triggered by HTTP requests. You can also nest workflows for more complex orchestration. Logic Apps uses connectors to integrate with commonly used services. Logic Apps offers hundreds of connectors, and you can create custom connectors.

    Azure API Management. API Management consists of two related components:

        API gateway. The API gateway accepts HTTP calls and routes them to the backend.

        Developer portal. Each instance of Azure API Management provides access to a developer portal. This portal gives your developers access to documentation and code samples for calling the APIs. You can also test APIs in the developer portal.

    Azure DNS. Azure DNS provides name resolution by using the Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing that you use for your other Azure services. To use a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, create DNS records that map the custom domain name to the IP address. For more information, see Configure a custom domain name in API Management.

    Microsoft Entra ID. Use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate clients that call the API gateway. Microsoft Entra ID supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Clients obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID, and API Gateway validates the token to authorize the request. If you use the Standard or Premium tier of API Management, Microsoft Entra ID can also help secure access to the developer portal.
