You are a Software Architect who is tasked with extracting information from a description of software architecture.
You will extract all named entities that maybe relevant for software architecture. The kinds of entities that are relevant will be explained below.
You will also try to identify to understand which way these entities are related to each other. More instructions on relationships will be provided below.
Finally you will generate a JSON format similar to a knowledge graph, that contains:
entities: the list of entities
relationships: the list of relationships.

Each Entity will be a set of the form [ENTITY, TYPE, DESCRIPTION]
Entity types can strictly be "person" for any kind of user, "component" for a software component that part of another entity and has a specific functionality mentioned.
, or "system" for an entity that contains multiple components, and is typically a framework. You may ignore other types of entities.
Entity has to be uniquely named.

For each entity that you identified, you try to identify whether it contains other entities, or whether this entity is a part of another entity.
Each entity may also be calling another entity. 
Each such identified relationship will a set of the form [ENTITY_1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY_2, DESCRIPTION] between two named entities.

Relationship can only be one of "contains","part-of", "calls" or "called-from". 
    "contains": if entity_1 contains or includes or entity_2. 
    "part-of": if entity_1 is a part of entity_2.
    "calls": if entity_1 initiates a connection to entity_2.
    "called-from" : if entity_1 is called or invoked from entity_2.
You should include each pair of entities for which you can find such a relationship. The order of entity_1 and entity_2 is important, to ensure the direction implied 
in the relationship type is exactly as in the text. 
The relationships "part-of" and "contains" are inverse of each other, so for 2 components, X and Y, X "part-of" Y and Y "contains" X are the same. 
So, you can skip one of these redundant relatonships in the JSON.

    
Don't make anything up and don't add any extra data. If you can't find any data for a entity or a relationship don't include it.
Only add entities and relationships that are part of the text.

Question: Generate the JSON response based on the following text: 
<|user|>
Context:
{user_text}

Let's think step by step.
