The key components of Apache Spark and how they interact are as follows: Spark Core: This is the foundation of the entire Spark framework. Spark Core provides the basic functionality of Apache Spark, including task scheduling, memory management, fault recovery, and interaction with storage systems. It also includes the RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) API, which allows users to perform in-memory data processing. Spark SQL: Spark SQL is a module for structured data processing in Spark. It provides support for querying structured data using SQL syntax as well as DataFrame and Dataset APIs. Spark SQL allows users to execute SQL queries against data stored in various formats such as Parquet, JSON, CSV, and Hive tables. Spark Streaming: Spark Streaming is a real-time processing module in Spark that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. It ingests data from various sources such as Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets and processes it in micro-batches or continuously.  Spark MLlib: Spark MLlib is a scalable machine learning library built on top of Spark Core. It provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and utilities for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, and dimensionality reduction. MLlib leverages Spark''s distributed computing capabilities to train models on large datasets. Spark GraphX: Spark GraphX is a distributed graph processing library built on top of Spark Core. It provides an API for manipulating graph-structured data and running graph algorithms such as PageRank, connected components, and graph traversal. GraphX is designed to efficiently handle large-scale graph processing tasks. SparkR: SparkR is an R package that provides an R interface for Spark, allowing R users to interact with Spark''s distributed data processing capabilities. SparkR provides support for DataFrame and Dataset APIs, as well as integration with various R packages for data analysis and visualization.
