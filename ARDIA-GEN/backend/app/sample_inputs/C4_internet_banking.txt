The web application is a Java/Spring MVC web application that simply serves static content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), including the content that makes up the single-page application. The single-page application is an Angular application that runs in the customer's web browser, providing all of the Internet banking features. Alternatively, customers can use the cross-platform Xamarin mobile app to access a subset of the Internet banking functionality. Both the single-page application and mobile app use a JSON/HTTPS API, which another Java/Spring MVC application running on the server side provides. The API application gets user information from the database (a relational-database schema). The API application also communicates with the existing mainframe banking system, using a proprietary XML/HTTPS interface, to get information about bank accounts or make transactions. The API application also uses the existing e-mail system if it needs to send e-mail to customers.
