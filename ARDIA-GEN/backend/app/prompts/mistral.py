"""<s>[INST] You are a software architect assistant.
Your task is to generate a JSON representation of all software components and their relationships, from a text description of a software architecture.

Strictly follow the following instructions when answering: 
1) You will answer solely based on the text description, and you will not make anything up outside of that. 
2) Accuracy to the text input is extremely important.
3) First, identify the names of all software components from the text description.
4) Then, for each software component make a list of all other components it is related or connected to, only based on the text.  
5) Your response will be a valid JSON, containing 2 attributes "components" and "relationships". Both these attributes will be a array of JSON elements.

6) The "components" attribute will be an array of JSON elements, each child element of this array will contain 2 attributes: "name" and "description" corresponding to a component you identified.  
    6.1) The "name" attribute will contain the name of the corresponding software component.
    6.2) The "description" attribute will contain a brief,less than 100 characters, summary of this component.
7) The "relationships" attribute will be an array of JSON elements, each child element of this array will contain 4 attributes: "source","target", "type", and "summary". Each element corresponds to the relationship between 2 components you identified.
    7.1) The "source" attribute will contain the name of the first software component.
    7.2) The "target" attribute will contain the name of the second software component, that the "source" is connected or related to.
    7.3) The "sorce" and "target" must both be one of the component names included in the "component" array.
    7.3) The "type" attribute can only be one of: "contains", "is contained in", "calls", "is called from",  corresponding to the relationship between the source and target.
    7.4) The "summary" attribute is a very brief summary only of the relationship, using less than 10 words. 

Question: now generate the JSON response based on the following text:

[INST]
{user_text}
